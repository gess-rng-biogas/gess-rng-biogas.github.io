                <h2 class="my-3">What is Biogas?</h2>
                <p>Biogas is a type of fuel that is naturally produced from organic waste, commonly manure or food
                    waste. Biogas is an important fuel type for many reasons. It is a renewable resource, unlike many
                    other fuels, such as coal, oil and natural gas. Using less fossil fuels leads to reduced greenhouse
                    gas emissions. In order to convert waste into energy, they must go through the natural process of
                    anaerobic digestion. Simply put, this is the breaking down of waste in a closed space. This process
                    results in the creation of methane and CO2. The CO2 is removed, leaving methane to be used as a
                    natural gas. This process leads to another advantage of using biogas, less water and soil pollution.
                    This process often occurs in a digester tank, meaning there will not be any chemicals being leached
                    into soil or water. Digester tanks can be found at biogas upgrading plants, which concentrate the
                    methane in biogas to natural gas standards. Another byproduct of biogas is organic fertilizer, which
                    means even less chemicals being used. Arguably the greatest advantage, producing biogas is low-cost,
                    if any cost, considering all of the payoffs. Manure and food waste will continue to be produced at
                    massive amounts and be readily available.</p>

                <p>Swine animal manure has been at the forefront for production of biogas. It is easily captured through
                    the slatted floors in swine barns and then stored in deep pits underground or lagoons above ground.
                    Deep pits have been at the center of controversy for some time due to the poor ventilation that is
                    often a reality for many swine barns. The chemicals from the decomposing manure ventilate through
                    barns and can be deadly to animals and humans. This is why manure is often transported to a digester
                    tank where it’s natural processes can occur without harming anyone. The average swine barn has 1,000
                    animals in it, some have more, and some have less. On average, one swine animal produces ten pounds
                    of manure per day. This means in one day at a barn with 1,000 animals in it, there is 5,220,000
                    pounds of manure produced. The biogas generation equivalent for this is 6,400,000 BTU per day. The
                    average household consumes 250,000 BTU per day. This means that one swine farm could power an
                    average of 26 households every day. There are many states that could feasibly do this, but the
                    leading states in swine production, Iowa, North Carolina and Minnesota, could benefit greatly from
                    this.</p>

                <p>The government is working to do their part in making clean and renewable energy the leading energy
                    source. There is a cap on harmful emissions that is allowed by companies and it gets stricter with
                    time. Companies are allowed to buy and sell their cap allowance as needed from other companies.
                    Since there is a limited amount of cap allowances, buying them is not cheap. This is intentional, as
                    it pushes companies to cut their emissions. Just as the government keeps track of fossil fuel usage,
                    they also trace renewable energy usage through Renewable Identification Number, also known as RIN.
                    The RIN number is traced to individual industries and companies to keep track of how renewable
                    sources are replacing fossil fuels.</p>

                <p>The government offers many incentive and grant programs for renewable energy. There is a grant
                    program through the USDA called “REAP”, which stands for Renewable Energy for America Program. This
                    is a loan or grant program for farms, ranches and small businesses to make their property more
                    energy efficient by installing renewable energy systems. Another similar program is the Solar Tax
                    Credit. This allows people to build solar energy systems on their property and then deduct 26
                    percent of the cost from their federal taxes. The original deduction when this began was 30 percent
                    and will fall to 22 percent next year. Another program that incentivizes with a tax deduction is the
                    Cogeneration Systems and Tax Credit. There is a 10 percent tax deduction for installing a
                    cogeneration system, which uses one fuel source to produce electricity and thermal energy.
                    California has a few notable incentive programs for using renewable energy sources. One is a
                    low-carbon fuel standard, LCFS, which reduces the carbon intensity in transportation fuels and
                    provides renewable alternatives. They also have a board of people who set and regulate emission
                    standards for vehicles, fuel and consumer products. Most notably of those doing their part to make a
                    difference is The Renewable Gas Coalition, who advocate and educate for the Natural Gas Industry in
                    the United States.</p>

                <p>With all of the efforts pushing towards renewable energy and the resources readily available to make
                    it happen, there is no doubt that it will be the leading energy source in future years. As it should
                    be, the advantages of biogas far outweigh the few disadvantages. The many loan and incentive
                    programs make it feasible for many Americans and we can hope to see more programs that will make it
                    an option for all. </p>
